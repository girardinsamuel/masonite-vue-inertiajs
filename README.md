# Masonite + Inertia.js with Vue.js

This is a demo (which is going to be improved to show different use cases !) of a Masonite app
with Inertia.js. The Inertia.js adapter has been developed by @josephmancuso (https://gist.github.com/josephmancuso/6528fe8ef9cb2f6cf25ccd19852ee7f1).

This can be cloned now to play with the demo =) !
